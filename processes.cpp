/*
Code a C++ program, named processes.cpp that receives one argument, 
(i.e., argv[1]) upon its invocation and searches how many processes 
whose name is given in argv[1] are running on the system where your program has been invoked. 
To be specific, your program should demonstrate the same behavior as: 
$ ps -A | grep argv[1] | wc - l
